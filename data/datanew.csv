"#Fall_Admissions2k19 #CS_or_SE_or_CE?? Hello, today I want to talk about a common topic of the group and that is *Should we do SE,  CS or CE?*  First of all let me tell yout that... CS and SE are BS programs CE is an engineering program Computer Science: As far as I know, Computer Science is all related to software, hardware, networking, data structure, algorithms, etc  Software Engineering(Non-Engg): As the name suggests, it is basically based on coding and software development throught the 4 years session. Computer Engineering: It is a mixture of Electrical engg and Computer Science. A CE student learns both about Hardware, Electronics, Software etc. 1. Is SE an Engineering Program??  The answer is NO!! Thats because it is a sub beanch of CS, and honestly thats the fault of or education system that NUST, UET, Bahria and a few more call it PEC accrediated and name it under engineering program However, it was designed by the international computer organizations as a subbranch of CS so that those who only want to study software can choose this field and at that time they called it Software engineering.. If you have a PEC accrediation number with SE degree and then you apply for an engineering job in any international firm they wont consider you as an engineer cause the whole world considers it just a BS(hons) program... So thats now clear that even if its pec accrediated or not, the world will consider it as a non engineering program.. 2. Can we apply for Software Engineer job after CE? The answer is YES! you can apply in any firm or centre, the only requirement is having skills and thats it!. 3. Is it good to go for Software engineering? Yes thats good to go, but consider that its not an engineering program  you are going for simply BS. 4. Is CS and SE same??? Answer is yes, almost... these two programs offer almost same curriculum and skills. 5. Is CE same as SE or CS??

" Many congratulations to all who have secured admission already. Just a piece of advice to people who are about to join undergraduate school. Do NOT attend engineering school unless you have a very clear road map in your mind to follow. The job opportunities are constricted owing to declining economic outlook and you may find yourself in deep trouble if you opt for engineering just by assuming that ""engineering ka bohat scope hai"". For those who are trying to figure out which career path they should be opting for consider IT-related disciplines, Finance and Law. Explore and weigh your options carefully and once you decide what you want to do then just work hard to prove your decision right. Best of luck for your future endeavours.",{'Adil Farooq': {}}

Code Compilers are different etc. I was looking towards buying a surface laptop but then again the experiances with lunix in dual boot setup are aweful (at least on reddit).

"Welcome Batch’20 Congratulations on getting admission in FAST. I hope you will have a fine time here. In Sha Allah you all will learn a lot here and believe me if you to want learn CS ,FAST is one of best places to learn and if getc you will have a very hard time here . There are few things I would like to share which might help you. First of all never ever ‘COPY CODE ‘from sites or batch mates because you will not learn anything if you start copying code in subjects like PF(...1ST SEM ) followed by OOP and DS , they are difficult because they want you to learn things. If you are good at Coding or getting good at coding help your classmates never let ‘Relative Grading’ get in way of it . If you want motivation try thinking about getting MEDAL , imagine getting medal in front of Auditorium and your parents/Guardians seeing this . Think about their happiness. (But Skills>>>>GPA) In Sha Allah there will be a lot of Events in FAST like NASCON you should participate in it but always give the ultimate precedence to your studies . Do not listen to people saying getting good grades and GPA is impossible its hard but achievable In Sha Allah your seniors will guide you through various programs like Buddy Sessions etc. At Last believe in Allah Almighty he is the Ultimate Helper and these are my own experience and opinions you might differ with it.

"In the coming week, a lot of you people might be facing a point to choose Computer Science or Software Engineering as a field. Being a victim of this situation, I would like to ask everyone to make a thorough research before selecting either field as a professional career.  Software Engineering mostly teaches you about the life cycle of a software product. Starting from the clients needs and ending up to the delivery to a client along with its maintenance. It's sort of Softwa...re project Management; programming is just a part of it.  However, Computer Science is more towards development. Courses related to management of software comes as elective here. If you choose this as your major, I would highly recommend you to learn basics of C++ (programming Language) before joining. These basics include : Variables, loops, functions and data structures etc.  Since, FAST is offering it the first time, things are not going to be much different. Both programs are going to be very similar.","{'Asim Zaheer': {'text': 'Software Engineering also related to Software testing and quality assurance etc. But there r very few jobs of software engineering.But in industries software engineers and CS are also doing same job.so its on u and your skills.no one will ask u that u r software engineer or CS student. they will only ask your skills and experience.'}, 'Muzammil Azam': {}}"

"Here are some FAQ's.  1. People are posting their aggregate and asking about admission? A) FAST never shows the merit list and aggregate. Each student gets his/her offer letter privately. B) This time as admissions are only on the basis of your inter and matric marks so no one have idea about the merit. 2. How many students get admission? A) FAST Isb campus has increased number of seats. For CS, 400 seats and for AI, DS there are 50 50 seats. 3. Hostel? A) FAST has no hostel (isb and lhr). You have to accommodate in private hostel 4. Medical Students can apply? A) Yes, but you have to clear exam of Mathematics either from concerned board or from University. 5. Should we choose FAST? A) Yes, you should choose FAST because of value of its degree and demand. The education, syllabus and work of FAST is very unique and challenging than NUST, COMSATS etc. 6) Campus life? A) The campus life depends upon campus to campus. The life at Islamabad campus is very excellent and probably best amount other campuses. Good Luck for your admission.

"For those who want to decide in Computer Science (CS) and Software Engineering (SE), First I will talk about CS, If you dream to become machine learning expert and learn the advancements of computer science than this field almost touches every field of study that is related to computer technology it is a vast field which keeps portions of all major fields like AI, Data Science, Cyber Security, Block-chain and much more, CS is no doubt best field generally, you can do research... oriented tasks or freelancing. Software Engineering is too much focused on Software development processes which are too booring for some people and could be very interesting for others and also there is not too much to code, but in the end they prepare you for management oriented tasks and your software analysis skills and requirement engineering will be very good, which is main requirement in those companies which are too much focused to follow software standards and want you to write best piece of code, However you do study some software engineering courses in CS as well. In Pakistan CS and SE both are treated equally and SE things are far gone when you implement code qk idr har kaam main ""Juggaar"" hi chalta hai, except some multinational companies which are very few.

" The Pakistani 🇵🇰 Govt has urged the Educat...ional institutions to #Alter ⚠️ their Fee structures, taking in to account the Ongoing Pandemic and the Economical Downfall that comes with it.  It was Reported that Fast NUCES has allegedly #Increased ⚠️ the Tuition Fee to 9500 per Credit hour (i.e. up to Rs.2000 Per credit hour increase) #without ⚠️ Even announcing the change and was Found by Students accidentally while surfing the website who strongly #Oppose this decision and demand a Decrease in tuition fees.  To paint the Entire Picture, this new Fee would stack up to Rs.171,000 to be paid #Per semester. This, too, would be without the 1st semester’s admission fee. This means that the #Total sum for the 1st semester would be a whopping Rs.211,000 after Adding the admission Fee and the Security Deposit. The Masters & Ph.D. Programs got increased to Rs.9000 per credit hour as well. Also Considering the fact that the university has gotten a significant Reduction in costs : - #No ❌ Lights, fans, air-conditioners & other machinery being used over 120+ Days (days in a semester) and will not be used in the next online semester. -  #Academic Costs are Zero i.e. no Lab Lracticals, No co-curricular Activities, No Events (for which we always Pay Funds Every semester) It seems that FAST Paid no heed to the #Backlash ⚠️ that LUMS received when they announced an increase in their tuition fee. Many other universities such as COMSATS and NUST seem to be facing the #Same issues Fast University soon Received a #Massive ⚠️ social media Backlash followed the announcement Fee increment Using the hashtags #FASTFeeHike and SayNoToFeeHike, students demand that their voices are heard and they be given their Due Rights. A Petition that currently Stands at over 4000+ signatures has also Been #Created ⚠️ to Reduce the Online semester Fee rather than increasing it. Students Hope, the Govt Authorities 🚨 will take #Notice of this and FAST- NUCES Career Services Office - CSO, Islamabad 🇵🇰 will Revert their Decision.","{'Abdul Sammad': {}, 'Muhammad Abdullah': {'text': 'my thoughts sucks, no one listening feel dead with thousand+ others'}}"

"Worth read👌i wish our educational specialist can understand too :/    A student studying in Russia says:  The highest score for most of the exams in Russia is 5.  If a student does not answer any question and returns back his exam paper blank, with no question answered, he gets 2 out of 5.    In my first days at the University of Moscow, I did not know about this  system and I was surprised and asked Dr. Theodor Medraev: ""Is this fair  that a student did not answer any questi...on and you give him 2 out of 5?  Why not give him a zero ?  Isn't that the right way ?""    He answered:  ""How can we give a Human Being a zero ?   How can we give him a zero to someone who was getting up at 7 am to attend all the lectures ?  How can we give him a zero since he got up in this cold weather, and  used public transport and reached to do the exam in time, and tried to  solve the questions ?  How can we give him a zero for the nights he  used to study and spent his money on pens and notebooks and bought a  computer for studying ?  How can we give him a zero when he left all other life styles and pursued his studies ?  Here my son, we do not give a zero to a student just because he did not know the answer.  We at least try to respect the fact that this is a Human Being, and he is having a brain, and he tried.   Because this result which we give, is not just for the questions in the  exam paper, it is also about showing appreciation and respect to the  fact that this is a Human Being and deserves to have a score.""     Truly I cried and did not know how to respond.  There I knew my value as a Human Being.    Zeros can actually decrease motivation on students, and can quickly  destroy them and make them stop caring about their studies altogether.   Once a zero score has been put in the grade book, they need no longer  care about that subject and they may assume that, there’s nothing they  can do about it.             Today I tell my story as a message to  our teachers, so as to change this shabby system of education which we  have in our country.",{}

"Students have taken some online classes these online classes have been of no practical usefulness. We request University, HEC and Education Minister to please c...onsider the following points. Courses like Mathematics, Physics, Engineering etc are taught by discussion, proper interaction. Boards are widely used where professor write and erase when students ask questions related to the subject as we progress through the lecture. These subjects cannot be taught using slide written material and sessions based on PPT slides. Instead of online classes, we request university to terminate all academic activities till 31 May and start classes from June.  Many students who have gone to village areas do not have internet access.  To summarize, we request UOL Administration, HEC and Education Minister to name this pandemic break Summer Break and restart the semester in June or Waive off our maximum fee as university’s expenditure is reduced a lot while teaching online and we have paid a lot. #SayNoToOnlineClasses #SuspendOnlineClasses  #We_Want_Semester_Break  #WeRejectOnlineEdu  PTI Shafqat Mehmood",{}

"Spend your summer break writing code and learning about open source development while earning a stipend up to $6000! Accepted students work with a mentor and be...come a part of the open-source community. Many become lifetime open source developers!  How does it work? 1. Organizations come to Google in need of interns. 2. Google then open applications for students. 3. Students submit project proposals to the organizations. 4. Organizations then take a month to select the best students. Note: All organizations come with an idealist where they have already added some project on which they want students to work on. Every project has/have mentors which help students throughout the process of applying to the during the internship. Link: https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/ Tips to get selected. 1. All the projects are open-source. Start contributing to them even while you are applying, and after you have applied. Also, stay in touch with the community once you have applied. This shows the organizations your level of interest and dedication towards them. 2. Write a detailed proposal. What you are planning to do. How are you planning to do it? The best approach you have in mind for something. Also, propose additional features in the project while writing your proposal. 3. Write your proposal in drafts and keep improving it. Never submit your proposal directly to the organization. Mentors are there to help you in the process. You should definitely ask them to review your project proposal.

"This metallurgical monday, we have brought to your screens another exclusive and heartfelt words by M. Basit Ansari.  ———————— ""They plan and ALLAH plans. Surel...y, ALLAH is the best of planners."" (8:30) To all young aspirants doubtful about their futures believe me if you keep hold to what Allah has said than there will be doors for you which will open sooner or later. What you need to do is to grab those oppurtunities, work hard and be passionate about whatever you do.  Honestly speaking i opted metallurgy just like most of you people did but what i aimed at the start is to work hard and explore the field. This field is vast, no worries if you don't like melting or casting, i didn't like it either (no offence to hardcore metal fans) that is why i left my job at People steel mill within 4 months. I still remember that time when people poked me & taunted me of my decision but if you want to achieve something great you have to dream and  you have to go out of the way with your strong inner belief and that is what i did. For 2 and a half years I worked in bits and pieces gave tutions,worked as a researcher and finally made it to where i dreamt of coming.  The key was that i remaind focus on what i wanted to achieve.  At the end what i will say is that world is changing, climate change is a big issue and materials that are advanced and sustainable are in demands. Metallurgy & materials are no different so do not limit yourself to metals only. focus on what you people are doing, focus on studies with keeping a balance of your life and the oppurtunities will be there for you in future.

If truth be told, they lost nothing and gained excellent guidance, skills and the confidence to improve their performance for the many more debates to come.

"Here are some FAQ's.  1. People are posting their aggregate and asking about admission? A) FAST never shows the merit list and aggregate. Each student gets his/...her offer letter privately. B) This time as admissions are only on the basis of your inter and matric marks so no one have idea about the merit. 2. How many students get admission? A) FAST Isb campus has increased number of seats. For CS, 400 seats and for AI, DS there are 50 50 seats. 3. Hostel? A) FAST has no hostel (isb and lhr). You have to accommodate in private hostel 4. Medical Students can apply? A) Yes, but you have to clear exam of Mathematics either from concerned board or from University. 5. Should we choose FAST? A) Yes, you should choose FAST because of value of its degree and demand. The education, syllabus and work of FAST is very unique and challenging than NUST, COMSATS etc. 6) Campus life? A) The campus life depends upon campus to campus. The life at Islamabad campus is very excellent and probably best amount other campuses. Good Luck for your admission.

" So here's a story I never thought I'd be sharing. A stor...y I'm proud to call mine. Back in 2016, the 19 year old me with a bag full of dreams, cried. Cried because she worked immensely hard to secure a place in LUMS SDSB and despite getting in successfully, knew she wasn't going there. On 5th May 2016, as the payment deadline approached, she put a sticky note on her acceptance letter saying, ""Dear LUMS,  You'll always be my one and only.""  Today, the 23 year old me holds a different perspective.  Stepping into FAST took me 2 long years to absorb the change surrounding me. Despair and hopelessness would very often take over me, draining me of all my energy and motivation. In 2018, I finally decided to take a gap year and start all over but this time at LUMS. But before I could do that, I decided to explore. And THANK GOD I did!  During my last 2 years at FAST, I've had the most learned and exciting years of my life. Not that I haven't experienced moments of weakness, in the most critical times, in the most unexpected ways. I have, undoubtedly, faced massive downfalls but this place has never failed to pick me up. I have enjoyed immense opportunities and received tremendous appreciation and motivation from my instructors and peers, nourishing my ability to confide in myself and achieve goals I never knew I had the capacity for. (I know I did not get into Stanford but I'm sorry, my bubble of happiness carries nothing but little things.)  Few days back, I had the chance of visiting LUMS for the first time. I was more than happy to represent FAST there and bag in, for my institute, multiple awards along with the Overall Winner award (that too, with my very own FYP business idea!)  So you see, life does not always go as planned but that does not mean it's not going to go right. The 23 year old me is proud of where she stands and what she has. She's also thankful for her patchy past. Oh, I am glad to be from FAST!",{}

What’s even more exciting is that teams from all over Pakistan had participated from various renowned business institutes but our brilliant and perceptive students of FAST NUCES attained the aggregate first position in the event. We are warmed by the dedication and hard work FSM put into this event and proved the diligence of our faculty members and themselves. We pray for more ultimate success for students at FAST-NUCES.,{}

"""We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity"" For good ideas and true innovation, you need human interaction..., conflict, argument, and debate. TLC has given its students the biggest chance this year to explore and speak up the ideas that have been heaped down in their minds and hearts through the biggest event of the year THE INTRA FAST PARLIAMENTARY DEBATE 2019. And after two days of an amazing session of informative debates, today our hearty congratulations go to the winner Team D(Neha, Mustafa, Usama) for the wonderful efforts that they have made towards this two-day journey along with this team TLC would also like to congratulate the runner-up team GulBakaoli(Zeerak, Efshal, Wusutullah) who faced the winner team in the final face of, but could not make it. ",{}
" In the qualifying rounds many teams embarked... on an oratory journey of zealous debates, vigorous competition and eminent learning. The journey proved to be a gruelling one and only the crème de la crème could transition onto the next stage. However, it would be erroneous to call those who were not successful, the losers. If truth be told, they lost nothing and gained excellent guidance, skills and the confidence to improve their performance for the many more debates to come.  The vibrant competition was held among these teams: The competition ended on a high note as the last round of the day was also declared by our esteemed judges as the ‘Most Heated Round of the Day’. The topic was a precarious one: “Genocide in Kashmir” but both teams managed to keep it spirited and productive. Throughout the competition many ideas, opinions and stances were passionately exchanged and put forward each one worthy to aknowledge and applaud. ",{}

"AoA, last Sunday I submitted my admission application for FAST-NUCES. I entered my phone number in personal information. But some days back my phone fell down and wasn""t starting and can't take out the SIM tray. Hopefully, I would be able to recover the SIM in a week or more(Corona outbreak in our region is so high now a days, so unsure about it).. The question is: Will I face any problem if I don't receive any message , like the one everyone got about application being accepted? And secondly, will we receive any Email from FAST-NUCES if we are selected?  PS I tried to edit my application(as there was an option) but was not able to change the phone number.

There will also be a video contest encouraging students to explore the culture and heritage of their part of Pakistan. An art festival of this scale will have a far-reaching socioeconomic and cultural impact.

"#Fall_Admissions2k19 #CS_or_SE_or_CE?? Hello, today I want to talk about a common topic of the group and that is *Should we do SE,  CS or CE?*  First of all let me tell yout that... CS and SE are BS programs CE is an engineering program Computer Science: As far as I know, Computer Science is all related to software, hardware, networking, data structure, algorithms, etc  Software Engineering(Non-Engg): As the name suggests, it is basically based on coding and software development throught the 4 years session. Computer Engineering: It is a mixture of Electrical engg and Computer Science. A CE student learns both about Hardware, Electronics, Software etc. 1. Is SE an Engineering Program??  The answer is NO!! Thats because it is a sub beanch of CS, and honestly thats the fault of or education system that NUST, UET, Bahria and a few more call it PEC accrediated and name it under engineering program However, it was designed by the international computer organizations as a subbranch of CS so that those who only want to study software can choose this field and at that time they called it Software engineering.. If you have a PEC accrediation number with SE degree and then you apply for an engineering job in any international firm they wont consider you as an engineer cause the whole world considers it just a BS(hons) program... So thats now clear that even if its pec accrediated or not, the world will consider it as a non engineering program.. 2. Can we apply for Software Engineer job after CE? The answer is YES! you can apply in any firm or centre, the only requirement is having skills and thats it!. 3. Is it good to go for Software engineering? Yes thats good to go, but consider that its not an engineering program  you are going for simply BS. 4. Is CS and SE same??? Answer is yes, almost... these two programs offer almost same curriculum and skills. 5. Is CE same as SE or CS?? No, because CE is an engineering program so its different in CE we will study hardware, electeonics like(sensors, ics, etc) and also programming and software related courses. 6. Should I do SE? Yes if you have interest and dont  care for an engineering program you can go for it. 7. Which one is better? CS or SE? Answer is CS Saad Iqbal CE - Fall19 (COMSATS Lahore) Joining Sept 2nd, 2019","{'Syed Athar Ahmad Bukhari': {'text': 'Everyone please ask from the seniors, ask from the those who have done it before and who have gone through the process.'}, 'Mubashir Ali': {'text': ""How can you say that this is better. Don't disturb students by saying this is better than other. After cs you can't get a job to do everything. You'll always get a job of some specific skill. (Btw there are more jobs of software development than other cs courses in pk) For me SE is preferable because it gives me more grip on software. So, try to remove point 7.""}}"

Do NOT attend engineering school unless you have a very clear road map in your mind to follow. The job opportunities are constricted owing to declining economic outlook and you may find yourself in deep trouble if you opt for engineering just by assuming that ""engineering ka bohat scope hai"". For those who are trying to figure out which career path they should be opting for consider IT-related disciplines, Finance and Law. Explore and weigh your options carefully and once you decide what you want to do then just work hard to prove your decision right. Best of luck for your future endeavours.",{'Adil Farooq': {}}

As I get to know some of students are getting confused about in campus classes. As far as I know I got the information from Aftab Sir and his PA classes for new batch will start on 21st September not from coming week. But as they change timetable again this needs to be re-confirm. Secondly Aftab sir said FAST is planning to keep continue the course as Hybrid-way (in campus & live online class). Because of social distancing students were not allowed to sit together so they are planning to provide that option whoever wants to take class he/she can come to campus or can take live-class from where he/she wants. live-class through any compatible software like live-session of facebook. But that Hybrid-way is still to be confirmed they haven't decided their final decision on that.,"{'Iqra Rafiq': {}, 'Abeera Rauf': {'text': 'Bar bar change ...apni zuban pr nahi rehte ...

"Recently, I went on a trip where I met a former teacher of mine who, on meeting and talking to me, said “You have not changed a bit since I last saw you!”(She l...ast met me around 6 years ago). I couldn’t help chuckling subconsciously at this fact because if my past, present and future self ever meet each other, I would be very surprised if we even recognized each other as being depictions of the same person. Before we get into the much anticipated meeting, I will categorize my past, present and future self with a difference of 5 years. This is because the past could be a second ago and the future a second ahead so that wouldn’t be much fun would it? The past self was a shy version of the annoying orange. She was equal parts introverted and annoying with a huge dose of spontaneity. The present self is a balloon full of anxiety with subdued spontaneity but better humor and who’s to say who we will be in the future? We can only hope to be the best version of ourselves and I know that my future self will have that zeal to be beyond conformity and become a woman she herself would be proud of. Also, she’s going to have a better fashion sense and probably more responsible. Now, considering we all recognize each other as the persona of the same individual and get over the shock because it would be a shock to see how much we’ve changed in appearance alone. Initially, there would be a storm of words and gestures full of excitement and hyper-activeness that is a characteristic found in all three. There would be a lot of scolding, laughter and embarrassment over the actions and decisions of the other and former self. The past self would badger the other two on the vast questions she had that no one answered, the present would reassure her comrades on working harder and towards her goal and the future being? She would pacify her underlings that all will be well in the end.  I think there is a comfort in your own company that cannot be found anywhere and what’s better than getting to talk to yourself as a whole other person? However, after the initial adrenaline rush is gone, there would come a moment of silence where all three of us would just look at each other and examine the differences and changes. It would be a moment of serenity and acceptance that would change everything. Although we have evolved and changed in many ways, be it the past, present or future, we stay the same person. Our major characteristics never leave us even when we feel as if we have lost ourselves. We remain the same even throughout all instances of time.",{}

"A lot of future students are worried in choosing their repective university. On the basis of my experience i would like to guide them but selection is totally on your need.  Why fast if your have other better option than it. Guys on serious note if you have any better option than fast go for it i.e. giki nust ned uet. (I got an admission in GIKI and fast both but due to my family reasons i had to choose fast). Waiting is not a problem. Look for more options keep your canvas b...road, what really you wana do not mera paroosi ne kaha ya meray papa ne kaha yeah chacha mama what so ever.  If you havent made up your mind go for markets requirement ( data sceince network security renewable energy(future) or transmission lines (power electrical) ). In fast i had admission for both CS and EE i choosed EE (it was my mistake beshak rizq ki Allah ke haath mein hai lekin mehnat humne karni hai to rizq tak pohanchne ke liye ziada mehnat karni pari).  If you have finances go abroad. In europe alot of countries offer free education in bachelors in top 100 unis. I have done my master from university of freiburg germany. The standard of education is much much higher in compare to any bachelor uni in pakistan. Their students are super smart and active. Living abrod teaches you alot of thing which you can never learn in pakistan which is as essential as education. Coz most of us are pampered my our family till 25.  Thats all from my side. Humne bhi buhat shoq se fast join ki thi. Our batch was really big in the beginning i guess 90 but in the end we were left with 50 i guess most of them moved to giki nust or abroad.","{'Naveed Rehman': {}, 'Muhammad Soban': {'text': 'Yrr apnay in unis mein ist ka naam ni lia agr ist electrical or fast ki electrical ko compare kia jai to ziada best konsi hai'}}"

They are honest from their point of view. What Fast does for you Fast will provide a platform for you to shine out even if you couldn't get into GIKI, NED, NUST. MIND IT THAT THESE UNIVERSITIES HAVE THEIR GRADUATES WORKING IN DIFF ORGANIZATIONS FOR 25+ YEARS NOW SO THATS WHY THEY HAVE STRONG ALUMNI.  If you couldnt make it best of the best unis, Fast can be your mediocre option from where you could complete your engineering. It has better reputation than Sir Syed, IQRA etc. And yes education is decent, it will push you till your hardest point, mentally and physically. 1. Muhammad Hassan, Etisalat UAE 2.

"Well, it's useless to argue with you people (seniors) as you guys have more knowledge about a university, but my question is. Is FAST a really bad university regarding EE because I really love engineering despite its scope. There are many universities (ordinary) in Pakistan which are offering EE and students are doing it on a very large scale and even people are doing BBA from FAST, NUST, GIKI which I guess is something nobody can understand. My father told me. ""Do what you l...ove. The scope doesn't matter and if that thing has really no scope than be the one to make it"" So, what is the main problem we are discussing? Is this: 1) EE Degree has no value especially from NUCES,Khr 2) You wouldn't learn something extraordinary. 3) If you have more CGPA (maybe around 3.5) Companies still prefer NUST, GIKI, UET, PIEAS.  4) The student from NUST, GIKI, and PIEAS can outrun you in minutes.

"Meet Mr. Ravendar Bhojwani, Software Engineer at Amazon(USA) and Chair of IEEE Young Professionals Seattle Section. Mr. Ravendar is first ever Pakistani to rece...ive IEEE Asia Pacific Larry K Wilson Award (2009) and IEEE Computer Society Richard. E. Merwin scholarship (2010). His success story is among the ones who have inspiration for not only people and specifically IEEE members from his region only, but for whole world and considering that, HOIEEE interviewed him to explore more in detail on how he gain all that up.  In his own words he said "" After moving to USA for graduate studies, I volunteered as Global Student Representative for IEEE Computer Society and it was first time ever that a student was sitting in IEEE Computer Society Board of Governors to represent all student body. I have met and keeping meeting so many incredible people throughout this journey. Whenever I moved to new city, local section people are my first circle of friends that I have found. "" ""I started programming when I was 13 years old living in small town of Sindh Pakistan called Ghotki and I am talking about year 2000 when there was no internet available in my town and I used to walk couple of kms to use a computer though I eventually got one later on. I was bound to become a programmer as soon as I wrote my first toy program in GWBasic. What I didn't realize on that time was what software is capable of doing – it can change the world. I learnt this from IEEE. After joining IEEE in my freshman year, I was exposed to new technologies and research beyond textbooks via its technical magazines and by meeting amazing people from across the world. My definition of looking at any technical problem changed all together. Today while in Amazon as Software Engineer, I don’t think about how to solve this problem but what will happen if I solve this problem, what difference and impact my work is making in this world? My time in IEEE has been nothing less than a blessing for me. I met so many amazing people while traveling for various conferences across the world that I always come back with more adrenaline to do better and more good for this world. My volunteering experiences in IEEE ranging from leading a student branch as branch chair of 100+ students or very 1st Global Student Representative at IEEE Computer Society Board of Governors gave me excellent opportunity to build my leadership and communications skills. These intangible skills are equally important to succeed as an engineer in Industry as technical skills."" He further added- "" My message to student members would be please think beyond just landing a good job or getting “A” in class. Those things should be part of your journey but not the destination. As an Engineer, you have an opportunity and skills to change this world. Go out and do this. And IEEE and it’s member are great resources to help you out in this journey.""  Humans of IEEE wishes all the best to Mr. Ravendar for his future endeavors.",{}

For Example : Medical walo k liey All Subjects me 66 chapters Hai, or Medical Universities K Tests  September/October Main Shoro Ho Jatey Hai Tu Un K Pas 4 Mahine Hain Ager Wo 2 din Main 1 Chapter Parhengey Tu Unka  Course Asani Se Complete Ho Jaye ga or Revision K liey Ik Mahina Bhi Mil Jaye ga, Isi Tarah BCAT or ECAT Wale Bhi  Apne liey Time Table Bana ley. Har Chapter K Parhne K Bad Kam Se Kam 3 Differnet MCAT or ECAT K Books Se Us Chapter K MCQS Solve Karey or  Numericals Ke Practrice Itni Karey K Aap Har Numerical Ik Mint Main Without Calculator Solve Kar Sakey Q k MCAT  Walo K liye Test Main Calculator Allow Nahe Hota Hai. (Numericals Ke Practice Jitni Zyada Karoge Utna AP Kam Time  Mai SOlved Kar Paoge, Phir Kisi Trick Ke Zarurat Nahe hogi APko) ★ Text Books Per Zyada Tawajja Dey, 50% Se Zyada Bache Inter Main Books Dekhte Bhi Nahe Hain Srf Notes ko Follow  Karte Hain, Abhi Aap books Dekhenge tu Pta CHal Jaeya K Text Books Kitne Kaam Ke CHeez hai. ★ English Subject K liye Daily Vocabulary K 10 Words Yad Karey or Apna Grammar Acha karey. ★ Physics Mai Jo TOpics Samjh Nahe Arahe ho Wo Pehle Class 10th K Book Mai Dekha Karey, Class 10th K Book Main  Physics K Kuch Topics Ko Bht Ache Tariqe Se Explain Kia Gaya Hai. ★ Biology Mai Kuch Terms Aese Hote Hain Jin Ko Yad Karna Mushkil Hota Hai, Us K Lye Mnemonics Use Kia Karo.  Mnemonic Means Kisi Chez Ko Yad Rakhne K Lye Asaan Tariqa.  For Example :- Taxonomy K CLassification Main Zyada Tar Log COnfuse Ho Jate Hain Hain, Is K Lye Sir Nabeel Ne Hamey  Ik Mnemonic Bataya Tha (Khan PCO For Gup Shup). Khan Ka Pehla Lafz K Hai Or K Se Kingdom Ata Hai, Isi Tarah Baqi  WOrds Bhi Hain. ( Khan = Kingdom, P = Phylum, C = Class, O = Order, For = Family, Gup = Genus, Shup = Species). Is  Tarah Khud Soch Kar Menomics Banaya Karey. ★ Ager Apko Koe MCQ Ya Numerical Nahe Ata Ho Tu Inbox Main Puch Lya Karo Ager Mujhe Uska Jawab Ata Hoga Tu Me Bata  Dunga or Ager Mujhe Nahe Ata Hoga Tu Page Per Post Kar Dunga Koe Or Jawab De Dega. ======================= HOW TO CALCULATE AGGREGATE ====================== Medical Universities Main Aggregate per Admissions Hote Hain Means 10% Matric, 40% Intermediate & 50% Entry Test  Marks Mila K Merit banta Hai. Aggregate Malom Karne Ka Tareeqa :- Matric % x 0.1 + Inter % x 0.4 x Entry test Marks x 0.5 = Aggregate For Example :- Apke Matric Main 80% hai, Inter Main 74% Hai or Test Main 75 Marks Lete ho tu Apka Aggregate Aese  Niklega 80 x 0.1 = 8 74 x 0.4 = 29.6 75 x 0.5 = 37.5 8 + 29.6 + 37.5 = 75.1 Aggregate Bana Apka. Is tarah Test Main Zyada marks lenge tu Aggregate or Barhega.","{'Muhammad Saeed Khan': {'text': 'Bhai, in universities me kon sy unies engineering k liye best han ?

"By Noor Us Sabah (Topper of MCAT 2015) I prepared from KIPS throughout and took almost all their tests. I joined STAR for the crash and grand session and took 6 or 7 tests. Both may have helped. BUT THE ACADEMY DOESN'T MATTER AS MUCH AS YOUR OWN EFFORT. The real MCAT paper had many MCQs that neither STAR nor KIPS had prepared us for. The only way to tackle the MCAT is to study thoroughly. Academy is important for time management and practice. They also guide you about how to ...study and what to study. After that, it's your own passion that drives you forward. Many KIPS students got poor marks and same goes for star so joining an academy can't guarantee good marks. You have to enjoy MCAT. Don't take it as a burden. I loved studying for MCAT but I hated FSc like hell. And never lose trust in Allah and in your abilities.  In the end, always remember that MCAT isn't a test to determine your success or happiness because these things never depend on a single 150 minute test. What really is important is your character, personality, love for your people, and the ability to be thankful to Allah no matter what happens! Best of Luck dear buddies! :) :) :) - Copied pOst",{}

"[COPIED] *Key Points to Remember in your Aptitude Test, 1) Plan to execute. planning is really important, set your test margins and prepare yourself by proper time managements. Do not give priority to one specific subject as to achieve higher scores, you will have to conquer all the borders . 2) For biology, textbook book reading is all you want. Focus on human biology priorly. So far, we have not seen any NTS paper without variation and genetics chapter.... 3) Do not forget to memorize boxes given in your biology books. Once in KMDC test, islamic ayats were also asked from biology textbooks. 4) For chemistry, Finish doing numericals of 1st year first. Then come to theory of 1st year and 2nd year. By products and catalysts are equally important to memorize in organic chemistry. 5) As you know NTS has changed the trend for physics. Now they give almost 20 numericals from total 30 physics questions. Numericals should be your first target in physics preparation. 6) English MCQS are mostly easy in NTS test, but you never know where they are confusing you. Grammar and Vocab, reading and answer picking skills are mostly check. 7) Self Confidence and Time Management is all you need to have on test day. Stay relax, calm and confident. Do not waste your excessive time over one complicated MCQ, that might let you loose 10 easy MCQS there. 8 ) Too much thinking is crime in this test. if the topic asked is well studied by you, you'ld easily get the answer in first look. if still you feel some confusion between two or more options, try to re-read the question and recall your memory instead of staring at the options. 9) English MCQS are mostly easy in NTS test, but you never know where they are confusing you. Grammar and Vocab, reading and answer picking skills are mostly check. 10) One thing important. If unfortunately you are unable to get your target, do not be dissapointed or depressed. Disappointment is something we all deal with at some point in our lives. We all want certain things in life, and sometimes we get them and sometimes we don't. Feeling disappointment is perfectly normal, but we have to be careful how we deal with it. Everything is not for everyone. Indeed Allah is the best planner for us so, Trust on Allah, Move on, Look up the left over chances and Never give up.",{'Wajiha Shahbaz': {}}

"Let's hear it from our alumnus, Hamza Mirza about his time at FAST Faisalabad campus. I'm Hamza Mirza and i belong from BBA’12 FAST School of Management FSD Campus. I am currently doing my Masters in ‘International Marketing’ from University of Houston, Texas, USA. When i joined FAST in 2012, at that time i had a lack of confidence and was unable to stand in-front of class for presentations but with the passage of time, teachers encouraged me a lot to speak, selling products ...in market, dealing with tough customers, doing heavy projects which built my confidence  and polished my skills and abilities. Alhamdulillah! Today whatever i am, is just because of FAST. I got the best teachers in Faculty for the marketing who supported me not as a student but as a Family.  FAST has been a guiding light in my life; it enabled me to stand out in the crowd and shine at the best. This has helped me in my professional life as a Marketing Specialist.

Undoubtedly, FAST has got one of the best faculty, they always appreciated me and ma...de me to think out of the box. My only reason to join Fast in 2013 was to get a business degree, but fast has given me more than that it has developed me as a strong independent person. I still remember my First presentation where I was stammering and somewhere in the corner of my mind was thinking ‘I can’t do this for the next four years for just a piece of paper (The Degree)’. But I never knew that those class presentations will make me so much confident that today I can speak to the Finance Directors of UK daily on behalf of Bank of England.

" I have done my BBA from FAST. I am currently working as ""Assistant Director for R&D at Engro Corp"".

Today our startup ""RFID Technology"" is known for flawless services in RFID industry. Though... we might be small at this time, but we have managed to capture multimillion clients and are growing continuously.

"Let's hear it from Roger Nazir about his experience at FAST Faisalabad campus. I completed my under-graduation in Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences Faisalabad Campus. Currently I have been studying Master’s in Software Engineering at Blekinge Institute of Technology, Sweden in my third semester.   Fast University played a vital role to help me in achieving my dreams and they also assessed me boosting up my progr...amming and presentation skills. During my Bachelor’s Degree program, I developed numerous software projects, few were rated high and I represented my Final Year Project named “Customer Analyzer” in mega competitions like Microsoft Imagine Cup 2016 in World Citizenship Category. I won Microsoft Imagine Cup nationally in World Citizenship Category Competition among 13 cities and 43 universities in Pakistan and even my name is listed on Microsoft Blog which was proud moment for my university and specially my teachers who taught me so well.   I presented the same project in Startup Cup 2016 and was included in a top 12 in the Startup Cup 2016 from among 950 competitors. This event was held in the Marriot, Islamabad.  I came to Sweden in August, 2018 and during my studies, I applied for jobs and within one month three big companies offered me a job which was a great achievement for me. I selected one company who accepted me as a Team Leader in their company. Currently, I’m working as a Development Specialist at Skyes Sweden AB. Sykes is an American based company which is located in 21 countries worldwide and have thousands of employees.  I’m climbing up to achieve my dreams which was not fortunate, it’s all because I have taught so well from Fast University teachers. Fast University is a platform for those who want to achieve their dreams and have aim to do something especially in the field of computer science. I think Fast graduates are different from others because of their skills which they learned from highly educated teachers. My success journey is not small, but it was a long way to reach at the destination. I’m still struggling to make my university more proud and especially my beloved country Pakistan.  I have much to say but my achievements are enough to reflect every aspect of my journey.  Everything is possible if you have high ambition to do it.

It was their chance to explore the campus life, engage in various activities and make themselves feel at home, because they have not just chosen a prestigious institution, but also a famil...y. Here at FAST, we don't just want you to succeed professionally but we wish to see you reach new heights and above and beyond that we wish that you are happy here. So we let them unleash their superheroes on Superhero Day,took them back to their childhood with School Day  we let them explore their different sides whether it was Halloween or Movie Character Day because we want to let them paint their canvas of life in whatever way they want.",{'Saif Ali': {}}

"“Revamping the Government Primary School Project,” a final course project of project management and fundamental of management. BBA12, the project lead team, completed all the five process groups (ref. PMBOK) with the support of CS14-A. The aim of the project was to provide the students an opportunity to learn & work in a real world environment while benefiting the community. The project location, a school, is about a mile away from FAST NUCES Faisalabad-Chiniot campus. A scho...ol of 3 classrooms for 250 primary students was in abysmal condition for learning and development. A two-days project (Nov 27, 28), in which 13 powered LED lights were installed with all fixtures, electric insulation on hanging power cable across 3 rooms, placed an electric water cooler, fixed the slider, seesaw, soccer ball poles for sports and recreation, 50 trees plantation, erected a pole with national flag, and 4 different training and sports sessions. Next day the kids from the school were invited at FAST NUCES campus to see how education can practically improve their lives. They were placed at the computer labs, worked on computer games, painting competition, watched the engineering projects developed by FAST students, did sports, took lunch, and then each student was gifted with a school bag carrying heavy stationary and a prayer books in each. 72 volunteers including faculty, staff, and students participated in the 1st day, which doubled to only 149 student volunteers on the 2nd day. The management and administration staff of the campus provided the logistics and moral support. The campus dining caterer provided free cooking and catering services to 270 students and their teachers within an hour of two shifts. It was a self-sponsored project of Rs.141, 791.00 as a budget. The sum was collected through fundraising by BBA-12 through movie night, campus touring, and generous sponsors of Rs.84, 000 by themselves. The smile that we brought, kids that flying were flying in the air with jubilation and honor, was a true indication of the project success and its scope.""",{'Waleed Raza': {}}

"“One of Pakistan’s main concerns is investing in value addition to the abundant human resource,” said the President H.E. Mamnoon Hussain. While addressing the inaugural ceremony of the Chiniot-Faisalabad Campus of the FAST National University of Computer & Emerging Sciences, the President lauded the contribution of the private sector in shouldering the onerous responsibility of the state. The President commended the efforts of the senior management of the University and the m...embers of the FAST Board of Governors for their vision and hard work for setting up this quality seat of higher learning in the rural area of Chiniot-Faisalabad. In his welcome address Mr Wasim Sajjad, the Chancellor of the University, said that FAST-NU has emerged as a quality institution in Pakistan in the private sector. The University, energized by its distinguished faculty and strengthened by its brilliant students, now stands in the highest echelons of education in the country.  The University is always striving to forge new paths for a brighter tomorrow of Pakistan. Mr Qaiser Ahmad Shaikh, MNA, who is also member of the FAST Board of Governors, in his welcome speech, expressed his resolve to make education available to the youth of the area and make the region an educational hub. He opined that only through education can the nation achieve the dream of prosperity and  integrity. The President also awarded medals to the students for excellent academic performance. He also presented souvenir to Barrister Wasim Sajjad, Chancellor, Dr Amir Mohammed, Rector, Rana Ghulam Shabbir, Secretary General FAST, Qaisar Ahmad Shaikh, Member BOG and National Assembly, Chaudhary Mian Khan, Dr Aftab Maroof, Director, Islamabad Campus, and Dr Zia ul-Qayyum, Director of the Chiniot-Faisalabad Campus. The Chancellor presented the University Memento to the honourable President. Dr Amir Mohammed, the Rector of the University, in his vote of thanks, expressed the hope that all the stake-holders—the state, the industrialists, the philanthropists, and the academia will work in unison to realize the long standing need of national development and self-reliance.",{}

Before founding Gagism.com, Farrukh was working as a Digital Marketing Specialist at LG Electronics, Inc. Farrukh was recently featured as an innovation hero by the Punjab government and Google, at the launch of the Innovation Punjab policy.  As a student at FAST, Farrukh had already won two nationwide best blogger awards at Mobilink HTC BlogPad and at the Dell Streak 5 launch. Farrukh was part of the only Pakistani team that made it to the last round of Microsoft Imagine Cup 2011’s Windows 7 Touch category and was also the finalist at mBillionth Awards South Asia 2011, apart from being the software champ of SOFTEC 2011, held at FAST, Lahore. Farrukh was also on the Dean’s List of Honors from 2007-2008 and worked as a TA for Calculus in his last year at FAST. “The hardest lesson to learn, while still being at your undergrad school, is to learn the art of marketing your product. No matter how beautifully coded and designed your product be, if you don’t know how to market it, it’s more or less going to end up as a burden on your hard drive and that’s it. Luckily, I tried to learn this art in my last year, and I’d urge every other student to do the same. I can jot down a long list of international ventures that are being successfully run at the moment, and to everybody’s surprise, they are based in Pakistan. The common key element in all of them is the powerful marketing. If you can learn this art while still being at FAST, while concurrently going through its killing curriculum, there’s no stopping you.” says Farrukh.","{'Salman Nausher': {}, 'Farrukh Zafar': {}}"

" 1. Take a really long time to explain what your talk is about. 2. Speak slowly and dramatically. Why talk when you can orate?... 3. Make sure you subtly let everyone know how important you are. 4. Refer to your book repeatedly. Even better, quote yourself from it. 5. Cram your slides with numerous text bullet points and multiple fonts. 6. Use lots of unexplained technical jargon to make yourself sound smart. 7. Speak at great length about the history of your organization and its glorious achievements. 8. Don’t bother rehearsing to check how long your talk is running. 9. Sound as if you’re reciting your talk from memory. 10. Never, ever make eye contact with anyone in the audience.",{}

Pakistan considers Kashmir as the core unresolved issue between India and Pakistan. This issue has lead  to three wars and devoting a major portion of  Pakistan budget to defense. Kashmir Day was first proposed by Qazi Hussain Ahmad  in 1990. Government of Pakistan adopted it as... national holiday later on.   In this regard a ceremony was held in FSD campus on Feb 05, 2013.  Dr. Aftab Maroof, Director Campus and Mr. Arif Khattak spoke on the occasion. They discussed the importance of this day and talked about different aspects of the Kashmir dispute.

"Majid Azim BBA - 2005 CG Artist- WerPlay I joined FAST in the BBA program back in 2005. I did get admission in CS/TE but BBA seemed like a better option. Although i have changed my field now, but the time i spend in FAST has proven to be very useful. I dont think there is any other university here with such a diverse bunch of students. I personally know tons of students who have molded their future according to their passion regardless of what they learned at FAST. In the end, all that matters is what you are passionate for. FAST, i can say with surety, gives you a platform to follow your dream.",{}

"Zaheer Mukhtar Graphics Team Lead (We.r.play) Former President (FAST Multimedia Society) Batch 2004 FAST-NU, Peshawar Campus The dreams of my childhood to become a film director, 3d graphics designer and visual effects director did not seem to become true until i joined FAST-NU back in 2004.It was the place where i used to spent more time than my home because of the love i was getting from my institute and the efforts my teachers and fellows put in to make me well known for the short films, photography, graphics and visual effects i made. The life was full of fun where hard work was counted most. I was  provided the video camera by fast for the very first film of my life and then the support continued and was sent to almost every university level event in Pakistan. By being the president of multimedia society, I had an opportunity of gaining the leadership qualities. being the head organizer of sports competition, fun fairs, welcome, Fair-well parties, mushaira and debates, all taught me how to better organize an event. The practical experience counts most in professional life and that's what you can get easily from FAST. Pressure handling, aah that's just a child play. for being a topper in class for 8 semesters and participating almost in everything, doing a job as a free lancer and working as an RJ in FM101, all at the same time seems humanly impossible but that's what you also learn in FAST, the time management. For me a quality institute is not the one that just make you learn all the fomula's and theory in a course but instead the one that makes you a good and successful human being by polishing the true gem inside you. I had the best times of my life in FAST. The participation in events like NASCON, NUTEC, SOFTEC, TAMASHA and FUDC will remain ever green in my mind. With so many events in an year, how can one gets bored of the tough life in FAST. If i am given a chance to choose any life period from the past, it would definetly be the one spent in FAST.","{'Zaheer Mukhtar': {}, 'Sakib Janjua': {}}"

"Hello I'm a student of 2nd year Mechatronics engineering CEME, NUST.  Some of the tips I found useful during zero days: Stay in Jinnah and Abu bakar hostels as much as you can. Go to study room during your University timings. If a senior catches you, go to any authority in cadet battalion(prefer higher ones like BC or CC) and tell him that it's his duty to protect you. He will handle everything.... Never move in a group. Always Move alone. Seniors are mostly looking for groups. And congratulations to all who are about to become a part of this prestigious institute.

"To the Freshmen, Hi, I’m a 2nd year student of Electrical Engineering in CEME, NUST and wanted to share something with my upcoming juniors. Most of you are confused, alone and scared. For me, the first months of university were torture. I had no friends, no one to ‘buck me up’ after a bad result or a teacher’s scolding as my friends did in college. The ‘interaction’ with the seniors did not help this predicament at all. For three months I would pick my bag up and literally ru...n off home as soon as the class was dismissed. Then one day, sir Hamza Khalil comes up to me, tells me to put my ID card in my pocket and follow him. He takes me to the café and there I have the best Roll Paratha of my life. And gradually, the clouds seem to be going away, revealing a brilliant blue sky. Similarly in class, a fellow recognizes I’m struggling to get by and introduces me to some friends. We talk for what seems like hours, ranting on about how pathetic our lives are. The seniors in the bus became lenient, the gym and the sports complex were open to the juniors, we went on epic trips together and before I knew it, university seemed like home. Know that even alone you won’t be alone. You’re always one text away from your friends and all you simply have to do is reach out first. They might need you more than yourself. Be prepared to make the best memories of your life.","{'Jerry Saeed': {}, 'Ali Haider': {'text': 'Rao Obaid Rehman'}}"

Pehle to make sure you have the following things : Water bottle Umbrella or cape (Helps in Summer or wesay bhi it rains a lot at NUST ) Shades ya agr zyada conscious ho to sunscreen le lena coz bht paidal chlna prta hay ... Laptop le lo , specially kiyuke semester 50% online hoga.  Agr engineering kr rehe ho to thora heavy laptop lena , graphics card wala taake agle semesters may msla na ho . Baki dekho ragging ka scene km hi hota , mgr do interact with seniors specially sophos . Unse first semester ke notes , assignments wegera utha lena . Plus ask them about the teaching and marking style of each instructor. Coz ab ye FSC nhi hay . Ratte se kaam nhi chlle ga ,do some smart work .  Wesay to may lazmi kehta ke never ever miss orientation,mgr due to SOPs is baar orientation bhi thandi hogi , so your choice.   Plus jab tak cms id or password nhi milta , kisi senior ki id se wifi connect kr lena. ","{'ArOo Shy': {}, 'Muhammad Ahmad': {'text': 'Kya waqai 50% online h ga?'}}"

"1. Who is Registered Engineer (R.E)? ""Registered Engineer"" means a person who holds an accredited engineering qualification, whether working privately or in the employment of an engineering public organization and is registered as such by the Council. Registered Engineer shall perform all professional engineering works except independently signing design. 2. Who is Professional Engineer (P.E)? ""Professional Engineer"" means a person who holds an accredited engineering qualific...ation and after obtaining a professional experience of five years, whether working privately or in the employment of an engineering public organization, has passed the prescribed engineering practice examination and is registered as such by the Council. 3. What is the difference between Registered Engineer and Professional Engineer? A newly graduate is registered with PEC as Registered Engineer. A Registered Engineer can become Professional Engineer after completing five years experience and passing engineering practice examination (EPE). 4. Is it necessary for an engineer to be registered with PEC? An engineer cannot undertake any professional engineering works unless registered with PEC. Therefore registration with PEC is mandatory. 5. Does PEC register B.Tech? The qualification of B.Tech is not equivalent to Bachelor of engineering. Therefore PEC does not register them as such. PEC registers only such graduates who possess engineering qualification duly accredited with PEC.",{}

"Assalam-o-Alaikum It’s generally for everyone but CS and SE people must give it a read. I’m from CS Batch 2k19 and there was something bothering me about the current merit of CS and SE so I decided to write this here. Y’all might be aware of the fact that CS and SE merit has been getting higher for the past 3 years or so. I thought it would probably be capped with our batch but I was wrong. Be honest, most of you did not come here because CS was your field of choice. Let’s be... even more honest, most of you had no Idea what field to choose. But most of you chose CS/SE because someone related to you or your relatives/parents told you or them “CS mE bOhuT sCopE h bAcHa Cs mE jAo” while they or you don’t know the first thing about the said Field of Study. The reason is simple. They saw the merit getting higher and they recommended it, usually saying something along the line “bEta cOmPuteR kA zAmAna h” Have you, even for a second, bothered to think why the merit is getting higher? It’s because more and more people are applying for this field. Familiar with the concept of supply and demand? You are supposed to supply to the market what’s in demand. If the supply exceeds the demand it goes to waste. Same thing is happening with CS and SE. There are no new jobs in the market but people opting for the field are getting saturated. Higher merit just means there was more supply. Most of you might be scoffing and saying “fReE LaNcinG kR lEn gE , cS mE jOb ki KyA zAroOrat” Let me break it to you bacho.... aapke 4 saal yahan lagane ka koi faida ni jb ab freelancing me roz kaam dhundo ya phir basic salary pr job karo. Choose your field wisely. Kher congrats to everyone who got admitted in first list. Others wait , In Sha Allah apka bhi name ajae ga. R jinka ni ana end tk, ap sb unko galiyan do jinhon ne ye mashwra diya tha. R ainda dusron ko bhi ye baat smjhao","{'Umair Karim': {'text': 'I was way more interested in mechanical engineering than software Per mechanical me kahi admission nahi mila so i optioned for softwareAnd you are right agy kafi tough competition hoga regarding jobs'}, 'Ja FFar': {'text': 'CS krkai baahir jao 🌑 yahan kisi field ki jobs ni hain'}}"

Mostly students will be thinking either to study pre medical or pre engineering. Both fields are totally different.  Choose your own interest and never listen to people. If someone is best in medical, he would advice you for medical. If someone is best in engineering, he would advice you to join engineering. And if someone remained bad at medical, he would not suggest you medical & vice versa. Listen, there is not only medical or engineering, there is also Computer Science (ICS), business etc. Pick up only your interest. Never listen to people. Only listen to your heart, what you like biology or mathematics However, final choice is yours.

No one is forced to do anything they ain't comfortable with. Idk about other departments but at SMME the seni...ors are pretty helpful and there's a brotherly atmosphere, no one bothers anyone and everyone just helps one another. Department me ragging ge against strict laws bhi hen so it's a big No. Major ragging hostels me hoti he.

Merit no 433  Always wanted to do civil but donno why getting lots of second thoughts these days. What are the chances in Mechanical SMME btw?  Btw I'm interested in mechanical too but never met a mechanical engineer and know next to nothing about the field so my lesser interest is partially due to lesser knowledge. So should I select mechanical as a first preference or not.  Are there enough jobs for mechanical as compared to civil ya khawari hi hei? ... Which field is better. And what are my chances in the field.  Seniors please help..!,"{'Nouman Aqil': {'text': 'Jobs or scope chor do.

"Acha guys,Since many reached me personally to ask about change of program policy at nust so imma explain it here once and for all. You can also download the nust change of program policy from nust website. I will only explain change of program within engineering fields According to nust,change of program has 2 categories, category A and category B Category A: if a person wants to change program from lower merit to higher merit department,he/she will have to achieve 3.3 or abo...ve cgpa in first year and if you want to go from lower higher merit to lower merit program,then you must have mendatory cgpa(nust didn't mention how much but I think,if a person passes all courses with 2.5 cgpa and above,then he/she must be eligible) Category B:Those who do not fall under category A will be in category B,they have to give net and their aggregate will be made with 50% fsc and 50% net. Now procedure to apply: Go to nust and download it's change of program form (category A or B According to yourself) Fill the form and attach transcript of Your CGPA and and take it to your Department coordinator. He/She will sign it and then submit it in main office(you can ask department coordinator to whom exactly you have to submit it). After that,FBA meeting will be called and your application will be discussed and the list will be made keeping in mind the seats that are available in the department.if 2 people have same cgpa but only one seat,then the person who had better merit position will be given preference.

Ok So I think I have a very valid point regarding merit positions.Now to clear things up I don't know when merit positions will be announced I m going to talk about the system let's begin       First of all I just can't get around k humme merit position allot krna to Sahi hai but why do they provide last year closing merit positions of different disciplines when they are already available strictly talking about engineering disciplines an admin also posted last year closing me...rit positions I just don't get it. let me explain if u want to go in suppose ABC department which has closing merit position of suppose 500 Aggregate of 77% minimum now this generates three type of student mindset     1) Those who are totally safe( 78%+)    2) Those who are totally out( below 77%)    3) Those which are are left hanging in the middle ( having 76%)     Now the problem the system generates here is for Category 3 students they wouldn't know k iss saal merit Kam hogga ya zaida no clue they have last year merit they can guess their merit positions but majority would just change preference to be on the safe side and Wallah theirs the problem suppose merit drops then what?? Suppose seats have been increased then what?? Suppose less students apply in that particular field then what?? Problem yahan Agaya k different students get alloted in disciplines they would not prefer like if one wants to go into Mechanical but just to be safe he chosses electrical and Merit for mechanical drops toh dissatisfaction and this is due to the system.     These students will be left hanging no new information is provided when merit lists are announced except k apka ki merit position Kiya hai       Solution:     Now I think better way to tackle this problem would be k app iss Saal merit positions announce krte sath hi iss year k following information bhi provide kren like     No of seats for this year for example if they decide to increase no of seats merit will go down undoubtedly so bajaye iss k students confuse hn toh iss se better understanding hojaye gi      I hope k Mene merit positions Ka concept Sahi se smajha hai agr Nahi toh mazrt iss mamle meh seniors guide krdein toh bhetr hai   By the way I m not an engeenering student so just to make things clear Mene engineering ki example Di hope u get my point and if I m wrong about the whole concept then plz let me know,"{'Haider Ali': {'text': 'NUST ke ME and EE ke lia kitna aggregate zaruri h?'}, 'Rehan Hyder': {}}"

I can't understand why the merit of Civil engineering is little low.

"As we have received the multiple queries in our inbox section on NUST Allocation of Merit Positions and Merit selection List for undergraduate Admission 2020 so we're trying our best to sum up all the queries answered in a row. (In Sha Allah) Q: As NET-III is over now what will the admission phases to be up next? Now, firstly NUST will allocate all the candidates with their merit positions on the basis of the NUST aggregate followed by NET best scores. Once the candidates wil...l be assigned their merit positions they will be allowed to edit their preference list accordingly. Furthermore, when the merit position would be declared along with it there will be closing merits for the previous year (i.e. 2019) in all the offered disciplines through which anyone can predict one's position where the particular stands with. There will be individual closing merits for engineering, social sciences, natural sciences, agriculture, business and applied sciences. Option to edit the preference will remain probably for one week after then 1st Merit List will be declared. We are suggesting all the candidates to be selected in 1st merit list to apply for the hostel facility at its earlier because vacancy will be filled as if it never comes up. In NUST (Main campus, H-12 Islamabad), hostel facility is based on 'first come, first reserved'. Furthermore, mostly candidates bearing the appreciable aggregates along with any particular disciplines. For the campuses other than head campus (NUST H-12 Islamabad) hostel facility wont be challenging or hard.  Q: Which NET marks will be considered for the admission aggregate? NUST allows the candidates to appear more than once in any of its NET series and the best marks to be attained by candidates are considered for the admission aggregates. #Note:  1) Candidates mentioning their inter part-I marks will be required to fill out an undertaking form after selection as if they fail to fulfill the particular score target in inter Part-II result the admission will be cancelled after then (if admitted any). 2) Repeaters are required to mention their Fsc whole marks in admission application for aggregate calculation. Q: Can we edit the admission application thoroughly regardless of preference edit? Yes, candidates will be allowed to edit their application on login into NUST Account with your password and registered email once the merit position will be allocated and the option will remain open for almost one week. (In Sha Allah) Q: When will the merit positions will be declared this year? Probably, merit positions for NUST Undergraduate Admission 2020 will be declared within a week after 15th September 2020. (In Sha Allah). 1st Merit Selection list will be announced after one week then.",{}

The paper is titled: A Systems Thinking Approach to Evaluate the Impact of COVID and Online Education on Student Happiness and Wellbeing. The abstract of the paper has been accepted for the panel titled: A New Outlook and Emerging Needs for Education Systems Towards Addressing Impacts and Challenges ...of Coronavirus Era.  Umme Ammara has worked under the supervision of Teaching Fellow Mr. Hassan Bukhari.  She employes systems thinking approach to analyze the impacts of online education in the time of COVID in a holistic way. Using causal loop diagrams, she maps various pathways of impact, describe key governing system archetypes, and identify possible areas of high leverage. She further develops her learning to model a second-year undergraduate classroom using stock-flow models. Using this approach, she attempts to quantify the human perspective and predict how student happiness, self-esteem, stress, and wellness will behave over time if the lockdown and online education continue. These scenarios and associated policy options present a novel way of modelling and understanding the impacts of COVID and online education by presenting an analysis of the impacts on mental health and happiness.

A minor change in the concentration of these gases can cause serious damage to the miner's health and can cause death. So far, the health security measures for miners in the mining industry are grossly negligible leading to an average of 160+ deaths per month. This motivated us to do develop a device fitted within the helmet that can monitor the gases concentration, temperature, and humidity. The readings are recorded at the local server and the helmet can communicate with the other helmet of its own kind. This helps us in building a long array of connections in a mine that will assist in determining the location of the miner within the mine. With the purpose to serve the community, the project intends to secure the miner's life within the mine and to make the mining as safe as possible.

Furthermore, safely supplying the drinking water to consumers requires lot of resources as required for digging and laying down infrastructure. Our primary target is to solve pure water shortage issues of backward areas of Sindh where there is no water supply and people are forced to drink contaminated water from swamps and other accumulated water of rain. This project envisages to design and develop a low-cost system for a real-time purification and monitoring of water. The system consists of several sensors that would be employed to measure the physical, biological, and chemical parameters of water. EDR technique is used to remove heavy metals from water and an ultraviolet (UV) light system is used to kill microorganisms at an appropriate wavelength. With the assistance of Arduino and pH sensor, the project intends to assure the availability of pure water by recycling industrial wastewater as well as filtering the seawater, thereby, improving the quality of water that can be used for various purposes safely as fit for human consumption.

"The Center for Digital Humanities, back in May 2020, pioneered a unique competition at a time when there was no light at the end of the tunnel. The advent of COVID-19 and a global lockdown demoralized students, which inspired the Research Team to come up with The Multiplayer Online Boards competition. Crafted by the fans of Assassins Creed and Black Ops, MOBs was a competition that gave the students an opportunity to have fun, create, innovate, produce videos - for which they... could win CA$H!!! and most importantly keep their minds off the negativity prevailing as a result of the Novel Coronavirus.  First 100 students to register were divided into 10 teams having 10 members each from all batches of Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science & Management and Technology. Each team was assigned a scenario that they had to collaboratively solve and evaluate using critical and creative thinking and then give their solution in a 5 minute video clip. 6 teams made it to the final round and the best 2 were given 1st and 2nd prize of Rs. 30,000 and Rs. 20,000, respectively by our judges, Dr. Stuart Dunn, Head – Department of Digital Humanities, Kings College London and Ms. Rachael V.

"Join in the latest LIVE session of ThinkFest Conversations. It is going to be an interactive conversation on Professor Anatol Lieven's acclaimed new book 'Climate Change and the Nation State: The Case for Nationalism in a Warming World.' In this hard-hitting and exceptionally timely book, Anatol Lieven argues that the only way to generate sufficient support for rapid and radical action to limit climate change is to present it as a mortal threat to the interests and the long-t...erm survival of nation states. This will require environmentalists to mobilize nationalism and seek alliances with national security elites. This book is written in strong support of proposals for a “Green New Deal”, and advises how they could be greatly strengthened. In a section which foreshadows the Corona-virus pandemic, Anatol Lieven points out that the threats to the lives of citizens from climate change and its associated effects (heatwaves, natural disasters and the spread of tropical diseases) vastly outweigh the danger to them from other states. Joining Professor Lieven will be Professor Adil Najam Dean of the Pardee School at Boston University, who will bring in his experience of working on climate change for decades, especially in the Pakistani and South Asian context.

A correlation analysis of the h-index and alt-index is conducted at three different levels: field level, source (journal) level, and author level.

" Dr. Ahmed is Assistant Professor, Faculty of Economics. He has a Ph.D. in Economics from Washington State University. Author’s Profile: https://itu.edu.pk/faculty-itu/haseeb-ahmed/ Abstract:  There is an increased concern among many stakeholders in society that livestock production systems provide a low-quality life to the animals and therefore advocate improved farm animal welfare (FAW). On the other hand, producers are concerned that stricter welfare regulations would decrease their profits and hence their competitiveness. Given the relevance of the debate surrounding FAW especially in Sweden, and the lack of studies related to the beef sector, this study examined the impact of changes in FAW practices on economic performance of Swedish beef fattening operations. We modelled a herd of 50 cattle of either beef or dairy breed reared for meat production to examine the impact of increased space allowance, including a corresponding decrease in herd size, and increased forage-to-concentrate (FC) ratio. We found that a 1-m2/animal increase in space allowance was associated with a decrease of 18.9 and 10.8% in short-run, per animal profits in beef and dairy breeds, respectively. Sensitivity analysis suggested that an increase in weight gain and short-run loss in herd size due to increased space allowance were the most important factors. We estimated that an increase in the FC ratio from 40:60 to 65:35 was associated with a reduction in per animal profits of about 21 to 34% in beef breeds and 17 to 53% in dairy breeds, respectively. Sensitivity analysis indicated that reduced growth due to increased FC ratio was the most important factor. Our results suggest that an increase in space allowance or FC ratio in Swedish beef fattening operations may reduce farm profitability. They also imply that consequences of any policy instrument should be carefully examined to reach the goal of improved FAW along with improved profitability and sustainability for the farmer.",{'Hasan Ali': {}}

"Journal paper written by Dean Faculty of Sciences Dr. Faisal Kamran has been accepted for publication in the Springer Journal of Intelligent Information Systems, IF =  1.589.  It is titled ""Causal Inference for Social Discrimination Reasoning"".  The leading author of the paper is Mr. Bilal Qureshi, an ITU MS graduate and Data Science Lab RA, along with international collaborators Dr. Salvatore Ruggieri and Dr. Dino Pedreschi from University of Pisa.  Abstract: The discovery o...f discriminatory bias in human or automated decision making is a task of increasing importance and difficulty, exacerbated by the pervasive use of machine learning and data mining. Currently, discrimination discovery largely relies upon correlation analysis of decisions records, disregarding the impact of confounding biases. We present a method for causal discrimination discovery based on propensity score analysis, a statistical tool for filtering out the effect of confounding variables. We introduce causal measures of discrimination which quantify the effect of group membership on the decisions, and highlight causal discrimination/favoritism patterns by learning regression trees over the novel measures. We validate our approach on two real world datasets. Our proposed framework for causal discrimination has the potential to enhance the transparency of machine learning with tools for detecting discriminatory bias both in the training data and in the learning algorithms.

"Tallal Ahmad qualified as the only participant from Pakistan this year and also earned a travel grant to attend the summit. In 2016, IPAL Lab @ ITU hosted similar summit in Lahore, Pakistan.   About IDDS: International Development Design Summits (IDDS) are hands-on design experiences that bring together people from all walks of life to create low-cost, practical innovations to improve the lives of people living in poverty. Summits emphasize the importance of “co-creation,” th...e idea that working with communities is more powerful than designing solutions for them. During a summit, participants work in teams with community members from developing countries, learn the design cycle, identify problems and solutions, and test prototypes. After a summit is over, IDDS participants become a part of the growing IDIN Network of MIT Design Lab. Some continue to work on projects from the summit, while others pursue their own local innovation projects in a wide range of fields. The International Development Innovation Network (IDIN) enables a global community of changemakers to design, develop and disseminate innovations that improve the lives of people living in poverty. IDIN also helps individuals, projects, and communities move forward with funding and technical assistance. About IDDS Uganda 2019: The two and a half-week hands-on summit was hosted in Rhino Camp, a refugee settlement in Northern Uganda. The summit was held from 21st August 2019 – 7 September 2019.

Paper Abstract:  Two-dimensional (2D) metasurface integrated with strip waveguide in silicon-...on-insulator (SOI) has been designed to achieve high coupling efficiency for 3.8 μm wavelength. The optimisation in period and radius has been achieved using 3D FDTD. The calculated coupling efficiency in the in-plane waveguide for the out-of-plane surface illumination is over 90% with a bandwidth of 1 μm. The design is consistent with the available lithography using 400 nm thick SOI for mid-IR applications. Finally, monolithic integration can be achieved using standard multi-project wafer run.

" Project Abstract:  In this project, we propose to develop sustainable and cost effective free space optical access transceivers which meet the bandwidth requirements of at least 100 Mbps in full-duplex data transmission. The need to develop this system is to meet the bandwidth requireme...nts of access networks, especially in the bandwidth deprived parts of our country. This technology can directly benefit a number of institutes and social enterprises with applications such as: 1) providing/extending access to internet/intranet for schools, 2) remote monitoring surveillance, 3) tele-health access points, 4) local telco/community ISP extensions, and 5) connecting multiple offices/buildings.

The participants will learn movement, voice, speech/ articulation visualization and sensory exercises and emotional memory under physical and mental preparation of an actor on building a character. What makes this course unique is that the participants will learn the skills of acting through the process of acting. They will not only learn fundamentals of acting but also apply that knowledge in practice through a play which will be produced during the course and will be performed in front of an audience at the end of the course. So the participants from day two of the course will be handed over a script to understand the preparation and process of an actor. The course is targeted for both beginners and professionals because it’s focused on the idea and technique of acting as becoming which in fact is never taught formally or informally as part of actor’s training in Pakistan.

" Abstract:... Dopant-free carrier-selective transition metal oxide (TMO) contacts offer unique electrical properties pertaining to the rectification of doping-related issues in silicon (cSi) solar cell. In this paper, cSi heterojunction solar cell featuring TMOs of molybdenum oxide (MoOx) and titanium oxide (TiOx) as hole- and electron-selective contacts, respectively, have been realized using Silvaco TCAD. The photovoltaic performance has been evaluated based on the electron affinity of TiOx, its thickness, interfacial charge density, band gap, and operating temperature. MoOx with an appropriate work function prompts band bending leading to Fermi level pinning at the top interface. Insertion of TiOx with low electron affinity reduces the rear energy barrier against electrons from 0.86 eV to 0.15 eV. Minimum recombination has been observed for electron affinity values range of 3.6-4.2 eV. The rear interface defects (Dit) should be minimized to reduce the recombination and to facilitate transportation of electrons. The device numerically demonstrated open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 723 mV, short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 39.2 mA/cm2, Fill factor (FF) of 79.8%, and conversion efficiency (η) of 22.64% with a temperature coefficient of -0.08%/°C. These results validate the applicability of heterojunction design with fully-covered carrier-selective contacts that can be useful for industrial applications as it eliminates the need of doped layers with the associated capital-intensive and complicated fabrication processes.  https://itu.edu.pk/faculty-itu/haris-mehmood/","{'Engr Faisal Riaz': {}, 'Shaji M': {}}"

"ADMISSIONS OPEN: SHORT COURSES & CERTIFICATION TRAININGS Course Title: Acting Instructor: Sobia Zaidi This 5-week course in acting is designed for anyone who wants to learn acting. The participants will learn movement, voice, speech/ articulation visualization and sensory exercises and emotional memory under physical and mental preparation of an actor on building a character. What makes this course unique is that the participants will learn the skills of acting through the process of acting. They will not only learn fundamentals of acting but also apply that knowledge in practice through a play which will be produced during the course and will be performed in front of an audience at the end of the course. So the participants from day two of the course will be handed over a script to understand the preparation and process of an actor. The course is targeted for both beginners and professionals because it’s focused on the idea and technique of acting as becoming which in fact is never taught formally or informally as part of actor’s training in Pakistan.

" Dr. Muhammad Mahboob Ur Rahman, Assistant Professor at Electrical Engineering department, has published his paper titled, “Effective capacity analysis of overlay and underlay device-to-device communication” in IEEE Wireless Communications Letters, 2019 [IF=3.096] https://itu.edu.pk/faculty-i…/dr-muhammad-mahboob-ur-rahman/ Abstract:  Consider a device-to-device (D2D) link which utilizes the mode selection to decide between the direct mode and cellular mode. This paper investigates the impact of mode selection on effective capacity (EC)–the maximum sustainable constant arrival rate at a transmitter’s queue under statistical quality-of-service constraints–of a D2D link for both overlay and underlay scenarios. Due to lack of channel state information, the transmit device sends data at a fixed rate and fixed power; this fact combined with mode selection makes the D2D channel a Markov service process. Thus, the EC is obtained by calculating the entries of the transition probability matrix corresponding to the Markov D2D channel. Numerical results show that the EC decays exponentially (and the gain of overlay D2D over underlay D2D diminishes) with the increase in estimation error of the pathloss measurements utilized by the mode selection.

" Abstract:  South Asia faces one of the largest gender gaps online globally, and online safety is one of the main barriers to gender equitable Internet access.To better understand the gendered risks and coping practices online in South Asia, we present a qualitative study of the online abuse experiences and coping practices of 199 people who identified as women and 6 NGO staff from India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh,using a feminist analysis.We found that a majority of our participants regularly contended with online abuse, experiencing three major abuse types: cyber stalking, impersonation, and personal content leakages. Consequences of abuse included emotional harm, reputation damage, and physical and sexual violence. Participants coped through informal channels rather than through technological protections or law enforcement.Altogether,our findings point to opportunities for designs, policies, and algorithms to improve women’s safety online in South Asia.

About Super Abbu:... It is a hotline for low literate fathers in Pakistan that gives them access to information regarding pregnancy and delivery. The role of the father during this time period is generally limited to providing transportation and financial support, and that is not enough. Fathers are often the decision-makers regarding healthcare and, without proper knowledge, can unknowingly make choices that are harmful to both mother and child. When fathers call our hotline, a personality named Dr. Saba will answer and teach them how to care for their wives during pregnancy and the delivery. Dr. Saba tells fathers about things like the nutritional requirements of pregnant women, medical attention that they may need to ensure a safe and healthy baby and the possible costs a family might incur during the delivery, among other things. Callers can also listen to stories other fathers can record about experiences during their wives' pregnancy. This way, they can learn from others' experiences.",{'Salman Manzoor Gorssi': {}}

" Research paper written by Dr. Khurram Bhatti, Assistant Professor and Director Embedded Computing Lab at ITU, has been accepted at IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS), 10-12 June 2019, Washington, D.C., USA. https://itu.edu.pk/faculty-itu/dr-khurram-bhatti/ Abstract:  Intel’s x86 architecture has been exposed to high resolution and stealthy cache side channel attacks (CSCAs) over past few years. In this paper, we present a novel technique to detect CSCAs on Intel’s x86 architecture. The proposed technique comprises of multiple machine learning models that use real-time behavioral data of concurrent processes collected through Hardware Performance Counters (HPCs). Our proposed technique demonstrates that intelligent performance monitoring of concurrent processes at hardware-level, coupled with machine learning methods, can enable early detection of high precision and stealthier CSCAs. We provide extensive experiments with four variants of the state-of-the-art CSCAs. We demonstrate that our proposed technique is resilient to noise generated by the system under various loads. To do so, we provide results under realistic system load conditions with an evaluation metric comprising of detection accuracy, speed, system-wide performance overhead and confusion matrix for machine learning models. In experiments, our technique achieves detection accuracy of up to 99.51% for Flush+Reload attack on RSA, incurring a performance overhead of 1.63% and 99.99% accuracy on AES while incurring a maximum performance overhead of 8.28%. Our experimental results show consistency for Flush+Flush attack on different implementations of AES as well.

It is titled: Towards Algocracy: Politicized Artificial Intelligence  Abstract: Artificial Intelligence is increasingly being integrated in all aspects of society. From voice recognition to navigation systems to facial recognition systems etc., it is becoming impossible to escape the long reach of Artificial Intelligence in society. AI systems are increasingly being inc...orporated into decision-making mechanisms that were traditionally the purview of human judgment e.g., sentencing criminals, giving out loans, matching organ and donors, making disease diagnosis, drive cars etc. While it may seem that the algorithms that power AI are neutral and can be trusted more than humans to make decisions on our behalf, the truth is far more complicated. There have already been cases where algorithms have discriminated against people based on their race, recommended incorrect diagnoses etc. Thus, there is a need to counter possible harm that can be caused by AI. In this lecture, I will give an overview of how AI systems have already penetrated society and governance in the near future and how should we think about reducing harm from algorithms while maximizing benefit in what seems to be an inevitable march towards Algocracy - a society ruled by algorithms.",{}

About Super Abbu: It is a hotline for low literate fathers in Pakistan that gives them access to information regarding pregnancy and delivery. The role of the father during ...this time period is generally limited to providing transportation and financial support, and that is not enough. Fathers are often the decision-makers regarding healthcare and, without proper knowledge, can unknowingly make choices that are harmful to both mother and child. When fathers call our hotline, a personality named Dr. Saba will answer and teach them how to care for their wives during pregnancy and the delivery. Dr. Saba tells fathers about things like the nutritional requirements of pregnant women, medical attention that they may need to ensure a safe and healthy baby and the possible costs a family might incur during the delivery, among other things. Callers can also listen to stories other fathers can record about experiences during their wives' pregnancy. This way, they can learn from others' experiences.

" Dr. Waseem Abbas, Assistant Professor at the Department of Electrical Engineering, published his research paper in 2018 IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC).  The paper is titled: On the Impact of Trusted Nodes in Resilient Distributed State Estimation of LTI Systems.  Abstract:  We address the problem of distributed state estimation of a linear dynamical process in an attack-prone environment. A network of sensors, some of which can be compromised by adversaries, aim to estimate the state of the process. In this context, we investigate the impact of making a small subset of the nodes immune to attacks, or “trusted”. Given a set of trusted nodes, we identify separate necessary and sufficient conditions for resilient distributed state estimation. We use such conditions to illustrate how even a small trusted set can achieve a desired degree of robustness (where the robustness metric is specific to the problem under consideration) that could otherwise only be achieved via additional measurement and communication-link augmentation. We then establish that, unfortunately, the problem of selecting trusted nodes is NP-hard. Finally, we develop an attack-resilient, provably-correct distributed state estimation algorithm that appropriately leverages the presence of the trusted nodes.

It is titled, ""Fractional Fowler–Nordheim Law for Field Emission From Rough Surface With Nonparabolic Energy Dispersion"".  Abstract: ""The theories of field electron emission from perfectly planar and smooth canonical surfaces are well understood, but they are not suitable for describing em...ission from rough, irregular surfaces arising in modern nanoscale electron sources. Moreover, the existing models rely on Sommerfeld’s free-electron theory for the description of electronic distribution, which is not a valid assumption for modern materials with nonparabolic energy dispersion. In this paper, we derive analytically a generalized Fowler–Nordheim (FN)-type equation that considers the reduced space-dimensionality seen by the quantum mechanically tunneling electron at a rough, irregular emission surface. We also consider the effects of nonparabolic energy dispersion on field emission from narrow-gap semiconductors and few-layer graphene using Kane’s band model. The traditional FN equation is shown to be a limiting case of our model in the limit of a perfectly flat surface of a material with parabolic dispersion. The fractional dimension parameter used in this model can be experimentally calculated from appropriate current–voltage data plot. By applying this model to experimental data, the standard field-emission parameters can be deduced with better accuracy than by using the conventional FN equation.""

" Ms. Fatima Zaka and Dr. Shazib E. Shaikh from the School of Business and Management at ITU have published a chapter in the book: FinTech as a Disruptive Technology for Financial Institutions (Publisher: IGI Global, Pennsylvania, USA) By enabling better traceability of funds against specific assets, technologies should appeal to a significant segment of the lending market – one that is religiously conscientious. Such Islamic fintechs should therefore, be disruptive for the existing regime of Islamic Financial Services Institutions who have problems managing credit risk and compliance. Islamic financial instruments are no stranger to controversy. It emerged from the scandals that gaining investor confidence for Islamic financial instruments such as the Sukuk, which is the Islamic alternative to bonds and securities, investors demand more transparency in Sukuk to make sure they are Shariah-compliant, thus making traceability to assets an especial hindrance to current schemes of Sukuk. In this chapter, the authors will discuss how technology could be disruptive in Islamic banking and finance sector keeping Sukuk as a case. The authors will further elaborate on it by discussing our proposed model of blockchain that could solve the issue of traceability which could also boost investor confidence in Sukuk.

"Research Publication:  Dr. Saeed UL Hassan, Director ITU Scientometrics Lab, has published his research paper. It is titled: Deep context of citations using machine-learning models in scholarly full-text articles.  Abstract:  Information retrieval systems for scholarly literature rely heavily not only on text matching but on semantic- and context-based features. Readers nowadays are deeply interested in how important an article is, its purpose and how influential it is in fol...low-up research work. Numerous techniques to tap the power of machine learning and artificial intelligence have been developed to enhance retrieval of the most influential scientific literature. In this paper, we compare and improve on four existing state-of-the-art techniques designed to identify influential citations. We consider 450 citations from the Association for Computational Linguistics corpus, classified by experts as either important or unimportant, and further extract 64 features based on the methodology of four state-of-the-art techniques. We apply the Extra-Trees classifier to select 29 best features and apply the Random Forest and Support Vector Machine classifiers to all selected techniques. Using the Random Forest classifier, our supervised model improves on the state-of-the-art method by 11.25%, with 89% Precision-Recall area under the curve. Finally, we present our deep-learning model, the Long Short-Term Memory network, that uses all 64 features to distinguish important and unimportant citations with 92.57% accuracy.

The paper is titled: Fractional Fresnel coefficients for optical absorption in femtosecond laser-induced rough metal surfaces.  Abstract: "" The surface morphology of metal influences its optical absorptivity. Recent experiments have demonstrated that the f...emtosecond laser induced surface structures on metals could be dynamically controlled by the fluence of laser and the number of pulses. In this paper, we formulate an analytical model to calculate the optical absorption of a rough metallic surface by modeling the roughness as a fractal slab. For a given experimental image of the surface roughness, we characterize the roughness with a fractal parameter by using the box-counting method. With this parameter as an input, we calculate the absorption of an 800 nm laser pulse impinging on gold, copper, and platinum, and the calculated results show excellent agreements. In terms of physics, our model can be viewed as a fractional version of the Fresnel coefficients, and it will be useful for designing suitable surface structures to tune the light absorption on metals from purely reflective to highly absorptive based on different applications.""

" Dr. Usman Younis, Assistant Professor at the Department of Electrical Engineering, has published his research paper in the Journal of Physics Communications. It is titled: Towards low-loss waveguides in SOI and Ge-on-SOI for mid-IR sensing.  Abstract: ... Silicon-on-insulator is an attractive choice for developing mid-infrared photonic integrated circuits. It benefits from mature fabrication technologies and integration with on-chip electronics. We report the development of SOI channel and rib waveguides for mid-infrared wavelengths centered at 3.7 μm. Propagation loss of ~1.44 dB/cm and ~1.2 dB/cm has been measured for TE and TM polarizations in channel waveguides, respectively. Similarly, propagation loss of ~1.39 dB/cm and ~2.82 dB/cm has been measured for TE and TM polarized light in rib waveguides. The propagation loss is consistent with the measurements obtained using a different characterization setup and for the same waveguide structures on a different chip. Given the tightly confined single-mode in our 400 nm thick Si core, this propagation loss is among the lowest losses reported in literature. We also report the development of Ge-on-SOI strip waveguides for mid-infrared wavelengths centered at 3.7 μm. Minimum propagation loss of ~8 dB/cm has been measured which commensurate with that required for high power mid-infrared sensing. Ge-on-SOI waveguides provide an opportunity to realize monolithically integrated circuit with on-chip light source and photodetector.

" Dr. Umar Janjua, Assistant Professor at the department of Computer Science, has published his research paper in the journal: US Patent Application Publication. It is titled, ""Evolving a signature during trust verification of an object"".  Background: ... A cryptographic signature can be used to verify the trust of an object such as a certificate (e.g., of a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) site), an executable file, or user credentials. A cryptographic signature is typically static, and therefore, unchangeable. Consequently, if a determination is made that the cryptographic signature is no longer valid (e.g., the cryptographic signature is revoked, expired, and/or includes a weakness such as a broken algorithm or an insufficient key length), the process being implemented to verify the trust of the object using the cryptographic signature fails (e.g., is unable to be successfully completed). As a result, entities that create and/or submit the cryptographic signature to a trust verification entity in accordance with a trust verification request of an object are notified of the failed trust verification process and are subsequently tasked with additional work to create a new cryptographic signature that can be re-submitted and used to verify the trust of the object via a subsequent trust verification process. This additional work due to the inability of the trust verification entity to complete the initial trust verification process due to an invalid cryptographic signature typically requires human intervention and/or often delays requested device and/or network functionality, which can frustrate a user experience, for example.

" Dr. Waseem Abbas, Assistant Professor at the Department of Electrical Engineering, has published his research paper in the journal: 2018 Annual American Control Conference (ACC). It is titled, ""A Connectivity Preserving Framework for Distributed Motion Coordination in Proximity Networks"".  Abstract: ... A necessary condition for global performance guarantees in most of the motion coordination algorithms is connectivity of the underlying network topology. In proximity networks, connectivity maintenance becomes critical because the neighborhood set of each agent is dynamic and depends on the locations of all the other agents in the network. We present an efficient framework for distributed motion coordination in proximity networks. The proposed framework relies on identifying agents in a so called weakly connected dominating (WCD) set of the underlying network graph. Maintaining only the edges incident to the agents in WCD, which we call as critical edges, preserves the connectivity of the overall network. The proposed framework is presented in the context of rendezvous problem, which is selected because of its canonical importance in distributed systems with mobile agents. We propose a controller that drives all the agents to a common point by preserving the critical edges only. The proposed scheme is robust to failure of edges that are not critical and nodes that do not belong to WCD. Moreover, it performs well in terms of energy consumption and computational complexity.

" Dr. Junaid Qadir, Associate Professor at the Department of Electrical Engineering, has published his research paper in the journal: IEEE Access. It is titled, ""RL-Budget: A Learning-Based Cluster Size Adjustment Scheme for Cognitive Radio Networks"".  Abstract: ... Cognitive radio (CR) enables unlicensed users to sense for and access underutilized licensed channels (or white spaces) owned by the licensed users in an opportunistic manner. Clustering segregates nodes in a network into logical groups called clusters. In CR networks (CRNs), larger cluster size improves network scalability thereby contributing to reduced routing overhead; however, it reduces cluster stability as the number of available common channels in a cluster reduces resulting in increased number of re-clusterings and clustering overhead. This paper presents our proposed first-of-its-kind cluster size adjustment scheme based on an artificial intelligence approach called reinforcement learning. The proposed scheme adapts the cluster size with the amount of white spaces as time goes by in order to improve network scalability and cluster stability in CRNs. Due to the lack of progress in the investigation of cluster size adjustment schemes in the literature, this paper also analyzes their attributes, and then presents such schemes investigated in various kinds of distributed wireless networks. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme improves network scalability by creating larger clusters, and improves cluster stability by reducing the number of re-clusterings (i.e., the number of cluster splits) and clustering overhead, while reducing interference between licensed and unlicensed users in CRNs.

" Dr. Saeed UL Hassan, Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Science, has published his research paper in the journal: Behaviour & Information Technology. The paper is titled, ""A bibliometric perspective of learning analytics research landscape"".  Author's Profile: https://itu.edu.pk/faculty-itu/dr-saeed-ul-hassan/ Please access complete paper here: https://www.tandfonline.com/…/abs/10.…/0144929X.2018.1467967 Abstract:  Learning analytics is an emerging field of research, motivated by the wide spectrum of the available educational information that can be analysed to provide a data-driven decision about various learning problems. This study intends to examine the research landscape of learning analytics to deliver a comprehensive understanding of the research activities in this multidisciplinary field, using scientific literature from the Scopus database. An array of state-of-the-art bibliometric indices is deployed on 2811 procured publication datasets: publication counts, citation counts, co-authorship patterns, citation networks and term co-occurrence. The results indicate that the field of learning analytics appears to have been instantiated around 2011; thus, before this time period no significant research activity can be observed. The temporal evolution indicates that the terms ‘students’, ‘teachers’, ‘higher education institutions’ and ‘learning process’ appear to be the major components of the field. More recent trends in the field are the tools that tap into Big Data analytics and data mining techniques for more rational data-driven decision-making services. A future direction research depicts a need to integrate learning analytics research with multidisciplinary smart education and smart library services. The vision towards smart city research requires a meta-level of smart learning analytics value integration and policy-making.

"Head of Computer Science Department at ITU, Dr, Faisal Kamran, presented his paper, ""Overlapping Toxic Sentiment Classification using Deep Neural Architectures"" at ICDM conference in Singapore.  Abstract:  We are living in an era where data is enjoying an unprecedented increase in its volume in each passing moment through online media platforms. Such a colossal amount of data is multifarious... in its nature where textual data proves to be its vital pillar. Almost every sort of online media platform is producing textual data. Short posts (i.e. Twitter and Facebook) and comments constitute a significant part of this textual data. Unfortunately, this text data may contain overlapping toxic sentiments in terms of personal attacks, abuses, obscenity, insults, threats or identity hatred. In many cases, it becomes extremely important to track such toxic posts/data to trigger needed actions e.g. automated tagging of posts as inappropriate. State-of-the-art classification techniques do not handle the overlapping sentiment categories of text data. In this paper, we propose Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures to classify the overlapping sentiments with high accuracy. Moreover, we show that our proposed classification framework does not require any laborious text pre-processing and is capable of handling text pre-processing (e.g. stop word removal, feature engineering, etc.) intrinsically. Our empirical validation on a real world dataset supports our claims by showing the superior performance of the proposed methods.

"Paper Presentation:  Dr. Hina Khalid, Assistant Professor in the department of Economics, presented her paper in the Third Symposium on Global Health Policy: Advancing Health Policy Process Research.  Abstract:  HIV stigma is a barrier in HIV testing and treatment worldwide, yet research on how the disease is understood has focused on countries where the primary mode of transmission is sexual. Little attention has being given to disease understanding in countries where inject...ing drug users (IDUs) are the main vectors of disease transmission. I focus on Pakistan and examine how HIV and viral hepatitis, diseases that are predominantly spread through injection drug use yet experience varying levels of stigma, are understood, what stigma means and the consequences stigma has for HIV programs seeking to provide services to people living with HIV (PLHIV).  This is a multi-method study. To determine the key frames used for understanding HIV and viral hepatitis in Pakistani newspapers, I did a content analysisof a random sample of newspaper articles by developing a fixed-coding guide.To develop a deeper, qualitative understanding of how the diseases are understood and what stigma means I usedthematic analysis of newspaper articles andconducted 29 key informant interviewswith health experts across the four provinces in Pakistan. Themes for the thematic newspaper analysis and interviews were identified inductively. The findings highlight that although both diseases are spread through IDUs there is a difference in how they are understood; hepatitis is understood only as medical disease but HIV becomes a stigmatizing character trait. Therefore, PLHIV hide their HIV status while those with viral hepatitis do not. HIV is stigmatized by attributing it to immoral, un-Islamic behavior (extra-marital sex and homosexuality) and by linking it to death. The findings suggest a need to develop a counter narrative which emphasizes that HIV, like viral hepatitis, is a medical illness.

Given the current point in time, many universities have withdrawn from conducting Entry Tests and we envision several big names to follow. There is no official announcement from Punjab University - PUCIT regarding admission policy but our unoffic...ial resources have reported a potential withdrawal of entry test by PUCIT as well for this year i.e. 2020.  Hence, we have decided not to conduct any sort of classes this year. It was really a hard decision for us since it is the most awaited time of the year for us as well. We considered online lectures as well but felt they would not bring the quality and promise that we have been delivering for the past 4 years. Still we stay committed to the cause and hope to return back soon in a better world with even bigger plans. We wish all of our kind followers and their families the best of health in these unprecedented hard times. Hope this all ends up soon and we can reignite the torch of education. Thanks everyone Team Pioneers Institute PUCIT Entry Test Preparation Center","{'Omair Chaudary': {'text': 'What is the admission criteria this year??'}, 'Aizaz Haider': {}}"

"Mon, Sep 16 is the deadline to apply in Punjab University BS admissions 2019. For PUCIT you do not need to dispatch any documents or challan form. For IBIT you need to dispatch Paid challan form + CNIC/Bform photocopy to IBIT address. For all the other departments you are required to dispatch Application Form + Matric and Inter result card + Bform/CNIC photocopies to each of the department separately at their department's address. Note: If you haven't received Intermediate result card from college. You can print the result card from Board's website it is acceptable at the time application submission.","{'مریم راجپوت': {'text': 'Hard copy submission ki last date tu 20 hai?'}, 'Hafsa Azhar': {'text': 'Last year merit of IBIT??'}}"
"Preference Setting in PUCTI | CS / SE / IT Preference setting is completely your own decision tell your preference to PUCIT and you will get the class where your merit fits in. The important point to note here is If we have lower merit and we put IT A NC as the first preference and just in case your merit falls in IT M NC which usually has higher merit than Afternoon section. You will not be considered for any of your lower preferences at all. Always set your first priorities... on top preference no matter how low is your merit. As merit decrease with the new merit lists (2nd, 3rd) your name will automatically be promoted to your upper preferences if your merit falls in that class. Asking about the difference in OC and NC. It is exactly same as per the courses, labs and teachers. Choose the campus which is lesser in distance. SE vs CS vs IT always a top most question in every student mind. After 4 four years SE CS IT Morning/After OC/NC they all will be treated as exactly the same and start their career as Software Engineer following the same career path with exactly same pay scales. Still want to known what the difference is ?? Ok with an apology juniors this is too hard for an intermediate pass student to clearly understand what technical difference is but I will try my best. CS students will be offered Compiler Construction and System programming while SE students are tilted towards Project Management + Design Architect and study Software Design Architecture, Software Requirement Engineering courses. Ok you're lost in the techy discussion, warned your already :D Not lost ? okkk if you want to know more about the curriculum hit this link and check courses of each degree https://pucit.edu.pk/academic-programs/ To support my arguments and just to let you know CS/SE/IT is the debate not for PUCIT or Pakistan only. Other international universities also have these degree programs with very minor differences at BS level. On MS level you might a lot of difference in MS Data Science vs MS Network Engineer (All CS/SE/IT are eligible to apply any follow-up MS programs). Check these videos from some CS bloggers and you will learn more about these fields. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKEwYgLW9TU https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxvQYZJNLxI https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VpDcjFshJI ------------- Jazib Humayun, Software Engineer PUCIT Visiting faculty University of the Punjab, Lahore.",{'Mudassar Afzal Ch': {'text': 'Guide me about jehlum campus'}}

" A few rumors are being circulated on social media regarding COVID 19 positive patients in hostels along with a voice message regarding cancellation of examinations of Session 2017. These messages are false. The reality is that the administration is not aware of ANY COVID 19 positive patient in any of the UET hostels. A few students from a couple of departments are circulating test REFERRAL SLIPS only (NOT even one COVID 19 positive) and some... unidentified video clips to create panic for their malefide intentions. Following the HEC SOPs, both students with reported flu SYMPTOMS have been isolated in hostels. You should not pay heed to any fake news on this issue and focus on your studies. The University administration has taken all necessary precautions to keep its students and employees safe. The examinations will be conducted as per announced schedule, Insha Allah. Once again, you all are requested to follow the stipulated SOPs, especially wearing face masks and observing social distancing. Students not wearing face masks will not be allowed to enter examination halls. Stay safe.  Thank you and best wishes.  Muhammad Asif Rrgistrar",{}
